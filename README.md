# MusicAIGenerator
This application is a personal project of mine that I have been wanting to work on for a while which involves the use of Machine Learning/AI
to generate music. It utilizes a RNN neural network and LSTM as a way to be able to generate new music. So for example, imagine being able to
create music in the style of a certain artist or genre through the power of AI. That is basically what I am going for. This program was created
using the following. I am by no means an expert of AI, its meant more for my learning purposes along with being something I wanted to showcase
for fun:

-Tensorflow\
-Jupyter Notebook\
-LSTM\
-Neural Network\
-Python\
-Keras\
-Midi Files

For this example I used the Imperial March as my song. The .mp3 and .midi files are included of the Imperial March. The AI recognized musical patterns
from that .midi file and created new music. The file is called TestImperialMarch.midi or TestImperialMarch.mp3 and you can listen to it
as a musical sample to hear the end product.

Next Steps:
While a good start there are some things I would like to improve for this project:
  -Train for longer as I only trained the model for 1-2 hours and around 200 epochs/iterations\
  -Maybe use AWS machine learning tools to assist \
  -Find music that is longer and more diverse to get better results.\
