# MusicAIGenerator
This application is a personal project of mine that I have been wanting to work on for a while which involves the use of Machine Learning/AI
to generate music. It utilizes a RNN neural network and LSTM as a way to be able to generate new music. So for example, imagine being able to
create music in the style of a certain artist or genre through the power of AI. That is basically what I am going for. This program was created
using the following. I am by no means an expert of AI, its meant more for my learning purposes along with being something I wanted to showcase
for fun:

-Tensorflow
-Jupyter Notebook
-LSTM
-Neural Network
-Python
-Keras
